かね, かな

None

Mnemonic
The most gold in the land belongs to the King (きん) of England. In fact, you've never actually met someone with gold, it all goes straight to the King whenever someone finds some. You just have a few pennies to work with.

Hints

Picture the King on a huge pile of gold. Gold coins, gold candelabras, gold ponies. He's laughing and pointing at all of it while making very strong eye contact with you.

草 Grass

艹 Flowers 日 Sun 十 Cross

Meaning
Primary
Grass

Alternative
Weed

Mnemonic
You plant your flowers in the light of the sun in the shape of a cross, but it's too hot—the sun is too strong—and you end up with grass. Flowers can't grow in these conditions.

Hints

Think of how disappointed you are. You wanted a beautiful cross of flowers, and now you just have a big overgrown patch of thick grass. It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun.

Readings
On’yomi

そう

Kun’yomi

くさ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
The grass on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a cool saw (くさ) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.

Hints

Imagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through. The sun is beating down on you and the grass too, which isn't making it any easier.

光 Light

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
⺌ Triceratops 兀 Pi

Meaning
Primary
Light

Alternative
Shine

Mnemonic
You see a triceratops in the distance. But, it's odd. It's perfectly pi shaped (that is, circular, like a pie). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much light as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow.

Hints

Absorbing light is natural for reptiles, and a round one can absorb even more. Imagine this strange, round piceratops basking in the warm rays of light shining down from the sky. What a rare sight you've come across.

Readings
On’yomi

こう

Kun’yomi

ひかり, ひか

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
As you watch this majestic beast absorbing light, suddenly several dozen feral こういちs burst out from the wilderness, spears in hand. Oh no! Those こういちs are hunting this rare piceratops!

Hints

Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) こういちs attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. Little do they know that it's fully charged up after absorbing all that light, and it unleashes a bright flash of energy, rendering all the こういちs momentarily blind and allowing it to escape.

ｲ Leader 乍 Key

Meaning
Primary

Mnemonic
The leader's key is the key that makes all the other keys. It's sort of like the one ring to rule them all, the one ring to bind them... except with keys.

Hints

Imagine the leader taking his key to open up a safe that has a button to make other keys for the underlings. No key is as great as this key, though.

Readings

つく

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
The leader makes all the keys and puts them in a sack (さく) to distribute them to the underlings, who then cut them into shape with a saw (さ).

Hints

Imagine the leader making the keys and dropping them one by one into a big sack. He's always walking around carrying a big sack over his shoulder, distributing the keys to his underlings and watching them saw them into shape.

夕 Evening

Meaning
Primary
Many

Alternatives
Much, Lots Of

Mnemonic
How many evenings are there? There are many.

Hints

If you accidentally think "a lot" or something similar, that's okay too. It's the basic meaning that counts, and all these things are pretty close, though eventually you want to get to the point where you know that this kanji does in fact mean many.

Readings
On’yomi

た

Kun’yomi

おお

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading た we use the word "taco."

Let's start with the kanji meaning: many. You go outside in the evening (because that's what this kanji is made up of) and are surprised when you're hit by many tacos (た) flying from the sky. For some reason it's raining tacos, and of course you have no idea why.

Hints

The tacos pelt you and knock you off your feet. Hard shell, soft shell, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... it's terrible. And there are so many of them, flying from the sky to drown you in tacos. This is absolutely absurd (and you should think that too, so you remember the reading).

You know who loves meat? Nick (にく). You probably know a Nick — imagine him eating some succulent meat right now.

亠 Lid 父 Father

Meaning
Primary
Mix

Alternative
Mingle

Mnemonic
You put a lid on your father. But, he won't taste good alone, so you mix in some other ingredients. They mingle inside the pot with him.

Hints

This may seem traumatic, but actually your father is surprisingly into it. Imagine him mixed in with all kinds of other things. It's important to note that this kanji is about things being mixed in, not so much about the action of mixing. That's another kanji.

Readings

Mnemonic
With a mix of your father and other ingredients mingling in your cooking pot, you lift up the lid... your father pops up. Your father is こういち. He stares back at you with a big smile.

Hints

The King is now so near to you his nose and mustache are tickling your face. He's holding the axe high above his head and saying, "I can get as close to you as I want and you can't stop me because I'm the King. I can get sooooo close. Look, I'm not touching you though!"

Hints

To help this mnemonic along, literally imagine your older brother as someone that's just a giant mouth with a pair of legs walking around. It talks and talks and talks, too, irritating you. Feel the irritation specifically at your older brother. He's older than you, so you can't beat him up... yet.

Readings

Mnemonic
You wish you could box your loud-mouth older brother up and send him far away to きょうと. きょうと is super far away from where you currently live, so just ship your older bro off so he can never bother you again.

When the moon is bright, it's easy to see that a pig is indeed a pig.

Mnemonic
Legend has it that if you catch a pig in moonlight, it will tell you its secrets. Sure enough, this pig tells you it's from Bhutan (ぶた).

Nanori

Mnemonic
What if the rain actually tried to aim (あめ) for you? As in, drops would move out of their normal flight path just to hit you on your head? You'd be a lot wetter, that's for sure.

Hints

Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be? Also, あめ and "aim" don't really sound too much alike, but the goal is to use "aim" to get to あめ, so make sure to take note of that in your mind as you learn the reading.

米 Rice

米 Rice

Meaning
Primary
Rice

Alternative
America

Mnemonic
The rice radical and rice kanji are the same in looks and meaning. This kanji can also mean America, maybe because America is covered in rice or fields or something?

Hints

Aren't radicals nice? As nice and as fundamental as… rice. They make things so much easier, if you've been studying them.

Readings
On’yomi

べい, まい

Kun’yomi

こめ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
A ton of rice is grown in America. And yet you never see rice in American cuisine. So where's all that unused rice going? Actually, it all gets dumped into a big bay (べい). They have too much rice and no place to store it, so they've started using bays to store it.

Hints

Imagine helping to bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. A bay isn't the best space for rice storage, but it'll do. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay.

You run and run and run and suddenly you feel your soul (そう) leave your body. Still running, you turn around and see your soul running a few steps behind you.

Hints

Running really takes it out of you. In this case, it takes your soul out of you. Don't worry, when you stop your soul will collide with you again and everything will be okay. (Probably.)

Mnemonic
There's a mustache on the ground. Upon closer inspection, you see that the mustache on the ground is exactly the same as yours!

Readings
On’yomi

どう

Kun’yomi

おな

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
When we need to remember the reading どう, we use the word "doughnut".

While this is already strange enough, you notice something stranger. Over a couple feet away is a doughnut (どう) who also has the same mustache as you (and the one that fell on the ground). The doughnut looks at you for a moment, then scampers off. This doughnut must be a mutant because normally doughnuts don't move.

Hints

If it helps, imagine hundreds or thousands of doughnuts all around you with the same exact mustache. First of all, it's terrifying to be surrounded by thousands of mutant doughnuts. Secondly, it's really weird they all have the same mustache as you.

If you aren't sure what to say, just think about Genji (げん) and ask yourself, "What would Genji say?"

Hints

Genji is a real smooth talker. In fact, he can talk his way out of anything. If you can just stay calm and think "What would Genji say?" before saying anything, you'll probably end up saying something cool instead of something lame.

自 Self

Meaning
Primary
Self

Oneself

Mnemonic
The self radical and self are the same in looks as well as in meaning.

When we need to remember じ we use the word "Jesus."

You slide down a branch and your skin scrapes right off — ouch! Lucky for you, it was just your old outer layer of skin, and now you've got a fresh shiny layer. Yay for exfoliation! You're not sure what to do with this big, floppy layer of old skin, though…

Hints

Imagine sliding down a slide made of a big branch. The branch's bark digs into your skin and pulls it right off of your body. Okay, it's painful, but it's a small price to pay for having such beautifully exfoliated skin.

Readings

Mnemonic
Without your rough old skin to protect you, you feel the full heat (ひ) of the sun now. It burns… it burns! Yeah, you better protect that fresh new skin from the heat.

Hints

Your skin usually protects you from the heat, but imagine how raw it would be after you shed the old layer all at once. It's kinda vulnerable right now, so take care of it.

穴 Hole 工 Construction

Meaning
Primary
Sky

Alternative
Empty

Mnemonic
What was the biggest hole in the construction of the world? The sky. If you think about it, the sky is like a big hole someone forgot to fill in. That's why this kanji also means empty! Makes sense — nothing is more empty than the sky.

Hints

Next time you look up at the sky, try to imagine it's a big empty hole you're stuck at the bottom of.

Readings
On’yomi

くう

For some reason, you are standing on the sun. It's obviously very hot, but the thing you notice most is the sound of you burning up.

You have a wild viking child you have to take care of. He won't do anything but study, surprisingly. You can't get him to eat, use the bathroom, or anything else. He just wants to study.

Mnemonic
This crazy viking child who prefers study over pillaging (and other viking activities)... the other vikings just stop and gawk (がく) at him when they walk by.

Alternatives
Replace, Period, Age

Mnemonic
The leader for the ceremony can't come so you need a substitute to replace them ASAP!

This kanji has another meaning too. The leader can't come to the ceremony because they forgot what period of time it was. If they think they're in the wrong age, they won't come because they're trying to lead some monkeys in the ceremony instead.

Hints

Picture the leader of the ceremony out back, unsure of what period or age they're in, while the substitute leader walks in and stares at them in shock.

Readings

Hints

Imagine him in his coffin, changing from a begging position to a stereotypical "thinking" position. His hand is on his chin, eyebrows furrowed. Focus on the beggar's thinking. This is a pretty abstract idea to imagine, so it will be important to create a vivid picture in your mind's eye.

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
口 Mouth

Meaning
Primary
Times

Alternative
Revolve

Mnemonic
There's a mouth inside a mouth. But if you look even closer (not actually, but we're pretending), you can see another mouth inside that mouth... and another one inside of that one! It keeps going and going. Can you count the number of times there's a mouth inside a mouth? This kanji also means revolve too. Think of each "time" a thing happens, it loops back around and comes back to the beginning, revolving around again another time.

Hints

Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth. Dig deeper and deeper until it feels ridiculous how small the mouths are getting. Be sure to focus on the counting and the number of times you find one. Now, how many mouths is this times two, because your mouth is like this too.

Your kayak is slashing and dipping through the revolving mouths, going down and down more times than you can count!

ハ Fins 𠆢 Hat 口 Mouth

Meaning
Primary
Valley

Mnemonic
Fins decorate a hat, with (presumably fish) mouths stitched to it. Who wears strange hats like this? Turns out, the valley people are the ones who wear these. I'm talking about the "Valley Girls" of Los Angeles, California. They're into the crazy fashion, and they'll wear anything if it's deemed "cool" or something like that.

Hints

Imagine a bunch of Valley Girls walking around with these strange hats. Fins and fish mouths... what a strange new fad.

What a jerk he is. Imagine the deep tan lines on TAN-E as well. He's the epitome of robot laziness.

ｲ Leader 可 Lip Ring

Meaning

Hints

Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the naan (that's your なん), and then he screams at the naan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the なに). Smell the naan (you're there) and see the blood gushing out of his/her lip. It's terrifying. How did the naan even catch on his lip ring anyways?

生 Life 夂 Winter

Meaning
Primary
Wheat

The life radical is without the slide (as it sometimes is), but when you combine that with the winter radical, you have life during winter. What gives you life during the winter? It's the wheat you store away.

Hints

Imagine you're starving. It's cold and you've run out of food. You don't know what you're going to do. If you don't find something, you'll lose your life. Then, you break open a barrel, and wheat pours out. It's beautiful. You just found some life in the middle of winter.

Hints

Imagine the disappointment. You go from finding life to losing it all... now you have no hope for the winter :( Also, keep in mind that むぎ and mug aren't super-alike, so you'll have to use it to get  close enough to remember the actual reading, むぎ.
