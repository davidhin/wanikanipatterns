Your roof needs measurements done every year to make sure it will protect you properly.

Hints

If you think about it, your roof protects you from a lot of things! Rain, snow, bird poop. But if your roof's measurements are off it won't be able to protect you properly.

Mnemonic
If the measurements are off, and your roof doesn't protect you, then you get to sue (す)! If you're still alive, that is.

Hints

Odds are, the roof collapsed or a tree fell on you and you died from lack of protection. So now your family and friends are going to sue on your behalf.

舌 Tongue 辛 Spicy

Meaning
Primary
Quit

Alternative
Word

Mnemonic
When your tongue becomes too spicy for you to bear, it’s time to quit the jalapeño eating contest. You’ve been eating them for three hours now and the spiciness from the peppers is really burning your tongue. Throw in the towel, it’s time to quit the contest.

This kanji has another meaning too:

Eating isn't the only thing that makes your tongue spicy, so do certain words. Say your favorite words out loud right now. Feel them on your tongue. Words are the spicy food of language!

Hints

You may have to quit eating but you never have to quit saying words. Especially if you're, well, trying to learn a whole new language full of them.

Oh, you're probably wondering who won that spicy food contest after you quit and became obsessed with words instead. It was Jesus (じ). Who did you expect? He was great with words AND never quitting when things got spicy.

Hints

Picture Jesus scarfing down jalapeño peppers. He never quits. And then he says some words about how the jalapeños gave up their lives for this contest, so we better appreciate them. Thanks Jesus!

Reality

You have other things to do.

Hints

The squid cries, "I can build one that isn't so risky next time!" Ken shakes his head, "I'm not letting you do anymore risky things, you're coming with me from now on." Ken scoops up the squid into a bucket, hoists him over his shoulder, and walks off into the sunset.

Who knows what adventures await our new duo. All we know is that they'll definitely be getting into some risky business.
