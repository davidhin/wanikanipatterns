Hints

Imagine doing everything you can to get this hen out of your area, but it manages to dodge and outwit you at every turn. You even slash at it with your sword and try to run it over with your scooter, but the hen can't be stopped. This is the hen's area now. You have been defeated.

ｲ Leader 寸 Measurement

Mnemonic
This tree has an umbrella, which it's holding over its head. Strange, because trees normally like water… Turns out, this tree wasn't getting showered in water, but in dollar bills instead.

Hints

The sick part is that all those bills were once this tree's friends. Picture the tree sobbing uncontrollably, as pieces of its former friends fall everywhere around it. No wonder it needs that umbrella.

Readings

さつ

Kun’yomi

ふだ

Nanori

Mnemonic
And the person who gave the tree an umbrella to protect it from all those bills? Satsuki (さつ), a little girl famous for… handing out umbrellas, I guess. Makes sense that Satsuki would take care of these bills then.

Hints

Try to remember this little girl named Satsuki, since she'll come up whenever the reading for a kanji is さつ (there's a good handful of them). Picture her in your mind, with details like her hair and clothes. Maybe even holding an umbrella or standing by a tree? You should also know she's kind of a bookworm, I guess, in terms of personality. If you can imagine her clearly now, it'll be easy to remember さつ kanji later on.

Mnemonic
Elephants are great and all, except that when they die they turn into elephant zombies (ぞう). But you never see these zombies because the shougun (しょう) has a special project in place that destroys all elephant bodies when they die.

Hint: The readings and meanings for this kanji match up really nicely. ぞう is always for elephant and しょう is always for phenomenon. Remember it like this, the elephant is the zombie and the shougun keeps everyone from finding out about this phenomenon.

Hints

Picture the shougun standing over a pit of zombie elephants. None of these are getting out on his watch, letting people believe in such crazy phenomenons.

Hints

Imagine the end of the earth being like how they imagined it pre-Columbus era. Just a big drop going off into space, giant waterfalls plummeting down. Your crazy jet has made it to the very end! Congratulations!

When you get to the end of the world, you land your jet and put out a few mats (まつ) to sit on so you can view the sights.

氏 Clan

Meaning

Your clan is where you get your name. But not your given name, your family name. That's why people have names that mean "in a rice paddy" and "near the ferry crossing." The location of your clan determined your surname! Hope your ancestors didn't live on "Poo Lake" or something.

Hints

Think about your own surname in your language. Where did it come from? Were you a clan of village dwellers? Maybe you made shoes! You should look it up and find out!

You catch a fish. As you pull it out of the water, it starts yelling and pointing: "GO!" (ぎょ). "GO GYO GYO GYO!" There's a huge cruise ship coming right towards your little fishing boat. No wonder the fish was yelling GO at you.

Hints

It's great having a floor or bed, but whenever you use it you say yucka (ゆか) because it just gets so dirty. That's the one flaw of using a floor as a bed. In fact, it's the dirtiest floor you've ever seen, because it's covered in yucca (ゆか) leaves. You're sleeping on a yucca floor. Ew!

Hints

You can imagine how comfortable it is to sleep on a floor of yucca leaves, but at the same time how horrible the smell must be when they start to rot.

Hints

The eagle came from the sky and technically rescued him, but compared to where he was before, it may not be a better situation. I think this person is going to be eaten either way.
