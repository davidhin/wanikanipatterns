Seal

Alternatives
Seal In, Closing

Mnemonic
You take two clumps of dirt to make a measurement, using them to seal each side of your measuring tape, so it stays on the ground. This is the way people used to seal in things back in the day, back when we didn't have fancy things like tape and glue.

Hints

Picture sealing other things with dirt. Like the bricks in your wall. Or the hole in your floor. Dirt can seal in anything.

You can also seal food (ふう) in dirt to make it last longer. That's how jerky came about, you know. Seal some meat underground and in a few months you'll have some tasty dried meats to chew.

By the way, this has another reading you should probably know. It's ほう. Most sealing is done in the home (ほう), you know? So just think about eating food in your own home!

Hints

Dig up your sealed food and eat it in the comfort of your own home. Mm, delicious!
