You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and has a very distinct shape, just like this radical.

Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left. This radical also has that extra part sticking out at the top. See it?

Nine
Mnemonic
If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters "n" and "i" (the "i" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters "n" and "i" start spelling? Why, the word nine.

勹 Prison
Primary
Prison
Mnemonic
This looks like an enclosure of sorts — that's why it's a prison. Imagine a tiny prisoner curled up inside, staring off into space, completely convinced they're trapped forever. Ironically this prison is actually wide open. They're just so consumed with self-pity that they haven't realized they've been free to leave all along.

Mnemonic
What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is seven, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!

Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.


上 Above

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
ト Toe 一 Ground

Meaning
Primary
Above

Alternatives
Up, Over

Mnemonic
You find a toe on the ground. It's weird, because it's above the ground, not where toes belong.

Hints

Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly.

Readings
On’yomi

じょう

Kun’yomi

うえ, あ, のぼ, うわ, かみ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Of course when you find a toe above the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, Joe (じょう).

Hints

Try to remember Joe, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is じょう.

He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Joe as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) じょ. Although Joe will develop as you go through all the じょう reading kanji, for now, just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude, who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.

Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 下 Below kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.

下 Below

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
一 Ground ト Toe

Meaning
Primary
Below

Alternatives
Down, Under, Beneath

Mnemonic
There's the ground, and there's a toe just below it. Yep, you know this means "below" because the ground has a toe below it in this kanji.

Hints

Where's that toe again? Below the ground. Maybe it's your toe. Imagine digging it out and thinking, Ugh, why does it have to be under the ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?

Readings
On’yomi

か, げ

Kun’yomi

した, さ, くだ, お, しも, もと

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
You keep digging in the ground for the toe below, but instead you hit something hard and metallic. You try to dig around it, but it's huge. Turns out it's a car (か). Keep digging until you unearth the car below. (Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.)

Hints

There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is げ, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read 下 as げ. That's the problem with really common kanji — too many readings.

大 Big

Meaning
Primary

Hints

So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well.

Readings
On’yomi

たい, だい

Kun’yomi

おお

Nanori

ひろ

Mnemonic
There's this big guy (that's how you remember the radical, remember?), and he's wearing a huge Tie Dye (たい, だい) shirt. Because he's so huge, the tie dye shirt is also super huge. Everything about him is pretty big, but the tie dye stands out more than anything.

Hints

When you look at the big guy in your head, imagine him covered in tie dye head to toe. Think about how ridiculous it looks on him, especially since he's such a big guy. Shirt. Sweatpants. Hat. Shoes... it goes on and on.

工 Construction

Meaning
Primary
Construction

Alternative
Industry

Mnemonic
The construction radical and the construction kanji are the same!

This kanji also means industry, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.

Hints

Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning.

Readings
On’yomi

こう, く

Kun’yomi

None

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Every time a kanji uses the こう reading (there are a lot!), we'll use the character こういち. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Like this:

You see some construction in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only suspenders and a hard hat) is こういち, looking back at you.

Hints

If こういち as a construction worker somehow doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay. Just make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to construct a memory in that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations — where's his shirt, shoes, and pants, and why is he using the bulldozer like that?!

Alternatively, say you really like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better-looking version of こういち's face, though). You and こういち make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.

Anyway, when you see 工 in a kanji, it will often take the こう reading. Make sure to remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!

八 Eight

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
ハ Fins

Meaning
Primary
Eight

Mnemonic
This isn't exactly the same as the fins radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly "modified radical" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? Eight fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.

Hints

Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think "Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?" Yes, you do.

Readings
On’yomi

はち

Kun’yomi

や, よう

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
After you count and smell all eight of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large hatch (はち) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.

Hints

You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?

Turns out, after you enter the tent (remember how the person in the radical is entering one?), you're given a new (にゅう) one! Why? No idea, but hey — it's new!

Hints

Imagine lights turning on and flashing, and an entire audience inside. You're at a game show, and the announcer announces the neeeeew tent in his announcey voice. Feel the surprise. Feel the happiness. Feel the excitement. A beautiful new tent all for you!

Mnemonic
Think about mountains talking to each other, calling each other by their names and adding the Japanese name-ender san (さん) to each of their names. "Hello, Everest-san." "Oh hi, Fuji-san."

Readings
On’yomi

こう, く

Kun’yomi

くち

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Do you remember seeing the construction worker こういち earlier in the 工 mnemonic? If you haven't yet, not to worry!

For kanji with こう readings (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character こういち every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see こう, think こういち.

Everyone agrees, the mouth is こういち's best feature. You stare at it lovingly as he whispers sweet kanji readings to you.

Hints

You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a great mouth こういち has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?

Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is nine and the kanji is nine, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.

Hints

If you know your radicals well, this kanji will be a breeze!

Readings
On’yomi

く, きゅう

Kun’yomi

ここの

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, so that should make them easier to remember.

When you were nine your favorite foods were cookies (く) and cucumbers (きゅう). Yum yum!

Hints

Picture nine-year-old you, lining up nine cookies and nine cucumbers. You dip a cookie in milk and bite into it, then dip a cucumber in and take a bite. Nine bites each until they're all gone. Ah, you miss being nine.

一 One

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
一 Ground

Meaning
Primary
One

Mnemonic
Lying on the ground is something that looks just like the ground, the number One. Why is this One lying down? It's been shot by the number two. It's lying there, bleeding out and dying. The number One doesn't have long to live.

Hints

To remember the meaning of One, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab One in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words. Instead, it just splatters some blood on your face. "Who did this to you?" you ask. The number One points weakly, and you see number Two running off into an alleyway. He's always been jealous of number One and knows he can be number one now that he's taken the real number one out.

Readings
On’yomi

いち, いつ

Kun’yomi

ひと

Nanori

かず

Mnemonic
As you're sitting there next to One, holding him up, you start feeling a weird sensation all over your skin. From the wound comes a fine powder (obviously coming from the special bullet used to kill One) that causes the person it touches to get extremely itchy (いち).

Hints

Make sure you feel the ridiculously itchy sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number One up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground. It's so itchy that it's the most painful thing you've ever experienced (you should imagine this vividly, so you remember the reading of this kanji).

Only one person at Nintendo (にん) complained about the new jeans (じん) policy, and that person was you.

Hints

Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at Nintendo, and the policy has to be something about jeans. Then, imagine yourself as the only person complaining and everyone else in their dumb jeans (or lack-thereof) shaking their head at you because you're being a fool.

The radical that makes up this kanji is seven and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also seven. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.

You know this kanji means seven, so let's use that to remember the reading too. Seven is a lucky number, usually, but this time it isn't so good:

Seven percent is all she got on her test after she cheated (しち) on it.

Hints

How unbelievable is it that someone got seven percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the "she" part in she cheated (しち). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.

When you think of a woman, think of Jo-Anne (じょ), though she usually goes by just "Jo."

Whenever the reading じょ comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne. She's quite a short woman, which is to help us differentiate じょ from じょう (who is the giant, oafish farmhand Joe). じょ is a smaller lady, じょう is a giant man.
