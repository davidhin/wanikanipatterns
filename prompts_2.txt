本 Book
Primary
Book
Mnemonic
What's something useful you can get out of a tree? A book! Just cut that book right out of the tree trunk. If you think about it, every tree contains unlimited book potential. It's just a shame they have to be cut down to make the books…

Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

弓 Bow

Bow

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

牛 Cow
Primary
Cow
Mnemonic
This is the cow radical. It kind of looks like the long face of a cow, right? Specifically a boy cow, since you can think of that top horizontal line as its horns. Seeing it yet? It's got a little tuft of hair on its head, and some kind of accessory on the horn to your left, so this is a very stylish cow.
(And yes, you may say a "boy cow" isn't a "cow," but we're still calling this a cow. Please don't write in about it — we don't want any beef.)

Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

土 Dirt
Primary
Dirt
Mnemonic
At first this looks like a cross in the ground, but it's actually something growing in the dirt. It's a little sprout, already rocking three leaves. And it's all thanks to that dirt! When you see this radical, think about how amazing it is that things just, like, grow in the dirt.

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

夕 Evening
Primary
Evening
Mnemonic
This is the top half of a moon peeking out as it begins to rise. When does that happen? In the evening! Don't confuse this with the moon radical 月. 夕 is for the evening, when the moon's still low enough to be partly covered (by a mountain, for example).

------------------------------------------------------------------

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

目 Eye
Primary
Eye
Mnemonic
See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square eye. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit.

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

火 Fire
Primary
Fire
Mnemonic
This is the radical for fire. It's got three little flames on top and even a couple logs underneath.
But if it helps you can also focus on the person radical here. See it? It's got things coming off of it... What are those thi— OH MY GOD IT'S FIRE!!! Help, help! Put the fire out! Wait, it's fine… It's just the fire radical.

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

五 Five
Primary
Five
Mnemonic
If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number "5." You just have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, plus a few extra ends that stick out here and there. Once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means five.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 尸 Flag kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

尸 Flag

Flag
Mnemonic

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

手 Hand
Primary
Hand
Mnemonic
This is the hand radical. If you look at the palm of your right hand, the lines in it probably kinda look like the lines in 手. Sure it's not a perfect match, and everyone's got different hands, but basically this radical looks like the lines in your hand.
You could also think of the horizontal lines in 手 as fingers. That would make for a pretty alien-looking hand, but still a hand… of sorts…

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 冂 Head kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

冂 Head
Primary
Head
Mnemonic
This is the outline of a head. A really square head, admittedly, but try to imagine it facing to the right. The left side is the back of the head, and the barb-like part on the right shows the curve of the chin. See the head?

------------------------------------------------------------------

The cross in the middle is his body, with his arms spread out on the arm rests. The bottom stroke is the ground. See him sitting there now, looking all dignified. Talk about a kingly king.

Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

丆 Leaf
Primary
Leaf
Mnemonic
There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making this the leaf radical. It's a pretty wide and flat leaf, so if it helps you can imagine it as a lily pad leaf.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 儿 Legs kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

儿 Legs
Primary
Legs
Mnemonic
This radical already looks like a pair of legs. There's even feet on these legs. That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

中 Middle
Primary
Middle
Mnemonic
This is a stick going through the middle of a mouth. What kind of mouth? Mouth of a cylinder, mouth of a box, a human mouth — whatever kind you want to imagine, as long as the stick is going through the middle of it, since this is the radical for "middle."

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 月 Moon kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

月 Moon
Primary
Moon
Mnemonic
This is the moon radical. See how it looks like a crescent moon with a couple of little clouds floating by? Try not to mix this up with the evening radical 夕 — you can see the whole crescent moon this time, so obviously this should be the radical for moon!

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the ナ Narwhal kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

ナ Narwhal
Primary
Narwhal
Mnemonic
This radical looks like a narwhal. See the tail at the bottom, and the majestic narwhal horn poking out at the top? It also looks like the katakana character ナ (na), so you can remember it that way too. Na-na-na-narwhal! Just be careful not to confuse this with the treasure radical (メ). The sideways line for that one is at more of a downward angle, like an "X." But the sideways line for narwhal is horizontal (ナ).

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the ム Private kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

ム Private
Primary
Private
Mnemonic
This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in private. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 田 Rice Paddy kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

田 Rice Paddy

Rice Paddy
Mnemonic
In Japan rice paddies are made up of square fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is rice paddy.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

小 Small
Primary
Small
Mnemonic
You see two fins around a barb, but when you look closer, you realize those fins are actually two tiny fish. Think how small these fins (and fish) would have to be to look so much smaller than an already small barb. Talk about small fry… Yeah, that's why this is the radical for small.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 立 Stand kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

立 Stand

Stand
Mnemonic
This looks like someone in a standing position with legs planted firmly on the ground, spreading their arms out in a T-pose to maintain balance. So that makes this the radical for stand.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 止 Stop kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

止 Stop
Primary
Stop
Mnemonic
There's a stick and a giant toe stuck in the ground. Imagine walking along and seeing these things in your path. What would you do? Most likely come to a complete stop. You know, because of the toe. I guess a normal stop sign wasn't good enough, so they also put up this big toe to really get people to stop.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

丁 Street
Primary
Street
Mnemonic
Imagine viewing this one from above — looks like a couple of streets, right? Maybe a three-way intersection at the top there? Well, that's why this is the radical for street.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 刀 Sword kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.
Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

刀 Sword
Primary
Sword
Mnemonic
This is the sword radical. The ノ part is the curvy sword, while the rest is a samurai bowing deeply, like 90 degrees, as he holds that sword — probably before a sword fight. By the way, don't confuse this with the power radical (力). See the difference? In the sword radical (刀), the ノ doesn't pierce through the bowing samurai. (Lucky for him.)

You think it's over, but just as that group finishes, in come another thousand…

Display the kanji on the top with its meaning, then a picture that is a combined representation of the meaning and reading mnemonic.
Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

水 Water
Primary
Water
Mnemonic
This is the radical for water. It's the water radical because it kind of looks like water coming out of a faucet and splashing everywhere. See how it flows off in different directions too? Very water-like! As water-like as a radical can be, anyway…

Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

白 White

White
Mnemonic
Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it white. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white.

王 King 丶 Drop

Meaning
Primary
Ball

Mnemonic
The king has a big drop of liquid in his hand... but then he bounces it! The drop was really a ball.

Hints

This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a ball, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the ball) over and over again. Kanji are surprisingly playful like that.

Readings

Mnemonic
When he's done playing with it, the king gives his ball to Tamara (たま), the resident ball girl, for safekeeping.

Hints

Try to remember Tamara the ball girl. She'll come up anytime the reading for a kanji is たま, and usually she'll be involved with some kind of ball or round object. That's her job, after all.

Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are origin, real, and main. You can figure this out by thinking about how books mainly have their origins in real life.

Hints

Make sure you know those radicals, yo! And good luck with all the meanings (sorry sorry sorry).

こ

Nanori

The main reading here is し, so to remember it we'll use this mnemonic:

There is a child standing in front of you. You look closely at the child but something seems wrong. You rub your eyes and when you open them again, there is a sheep (し) in front of you. A sheep?! You yelp, blink again, and it's back to being a child. Are… are all children really just sheep?

Hints

The child (sheep) runs away and you chase after it. Every time it's about to turn a corner it looks like a sheep again, but whenever you yell and point, it changes back into a child. You're the only one who can see this sheep child!

Meaning
Primary
Circle

Alternatives
Circular, Round

Mnemonic
What's something with nine sides? Just add a drop and you'll have something that's almost a circle.

Readings

まる

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should check it out. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worthwhile.

When you think about a circle, think about Maru all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.

Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to "Maru."

Hints

Obviously if you "don't know this reading" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?

Meaning
Primary
Exit

Mnemonic
There are two mountains in front of you... and probably a bunch more around you too. You are in a pass, and don't know how to get out. You are frantically looking for the exit before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.

Hints

In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of "needing to get out of the mountain pass." If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji.

As you're trying to exit this mountain range, you suddenly realize that someone is actually hunting you. What? Make sure to feel that sudden realization. It's crazy. Then, you find the exit and run towards it. Sadly, the hunter is waiting there, and he shoots you (しゅつ) through the leg, knocking you down.

Hints

Focus on the surprise of realizing you're being hunted while trying to find the exit to the mountain range, then focus on the next part, where you get shot. View it in your head as the hunter shooting you. Powww!

Your eyes are important to you, right? Sadly, one of your eyes is missing right now, because a sheep grabbed it and pulled it out, and is now running away from you, yelling his sheep call.... "Mehhhhhh (め)!"

Hints

Of course, feel the pain of your eye being gone... and struggle to get it back. You eventually give up because the sheep is too fast, but then you come up with an idea. What if I call out back to the sheep in its own language? Go ahead and cover one eye and start making "MEHHH" noises to see if you can get the sheep to come back to you and give you your eye. It's up to you whether it works or not, but be sure to feel frustrated by its reaction, or happy by it. Either one works.

か

Kun’yomi

ひ, ほ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Whenever we need to remember か, we use the word car.

For this kanji, when we think fire, we ought to think of something on fire. What's on fire? It's obviously your very own car (か)! Oh Goddd NOOO!

Hints

Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a car, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think fire, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames. Now you have to walk everywhere, sad :(

Mnemonic
Now that you have four sides, you look like a four-sided animal: the sheep (し). Look at yourself in the mirror and see an adorable four-sided sheep looking back at you. Imagine yourself with perfectly square wool. (You can only see four sides because mirrors aren't 3D. So you're a flat, cartoonish sheep.)

Hints

What's better than a four-sided sheep?

Hints

You try to shake your hands off, but it's no good. The televisions are stuck, and the volume won't go down. You have no idea how you got these televisions on your hands. All you know is that you want them off right this instant.

Heaven... nowadays, people aren't all that good. Things have gotten bad. That's why the acceptance rate to get into heaven is only ten (てん) percent!

Hints

Imagine yourself in line to get into heaven. You're super worried, because you're not sure if you'll get in. You heard there was a one in ten chance... those aren't good odds.

Mnemonic
When you see the king you need to say, "Oh (おう) King! Oh King, oh no, oh why are you looking at me like that? Oh King... you aren't going to chop off my head are you? OH NO!"

Hints

You need to be polite when you talk to the king and add "Oh" to the beginning, otherwise the king will be pretty angry and bad things might happen.

左 Left

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
ナ Narwhal 工 Construction

Meaning
Primary
Left

Mnemonic
Narwhals do construction with their left hands (or flippers, I guess). That's because all narwhals are left-handed!

Hints

Picture a bunch of narwhals constructing an underwater ice village. They're all working away with their left hands.

Readings
On’yomi

さ

Kun’yomi

ひだり

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
In their left hands, the narwhals all hold saws (さ). That's because the ice for their homes is already there, so they just need to saw away at them to make the shapes they want. Narwhal construction is actually very simple.

Hints

If you're right-handed, imagine trying to use these left-handed saws. It flips and flops all over until you drop it. But if you're left-handed it feels just right!

Readings
On’yomi

ちゅう

Kun’yomi

なか

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word Chewbacca to pull up ちゅう in our memory.

If you remember back to the radical 中, a stick was stuck in the middle of the mouth of something. Let's say it was your mouth, and when you look up to see who did it, there stands Chewbacca. He's even doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his bowcaster. It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.

Hints

Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who shot the middle of your mouth (and head). Touch his fur. Look really close at his weapon. Give him a sniff, too. Just so that memory never fades away.

Readings
On’yomi

げつ, がつ

Kun’yomi

つき

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
The moon really gets (げつ) to your guts (がつ). Staring at the moon for too long will give you terrible indigestion, so be careful!

Hints

Use the げつ reading when this kanji means "moon", in words like "moonlight". Use げつ for counting months, and saying things like "last month and "next month", too. Go for がつ in the names of months, like "January".

Don't worry too much about memorizing this pattern, though. You'll be getting lots of practice soon!

Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 々 Repeater kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.

々 Repeater

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
勹 Prison 丶 Drop

Meaning
Primary
Repeater

Alternatives
Repetition, Reduplication, Iteration Mark

Mnemonic
This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: 人々 is actually 人人. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the repeater. It repeats what comes before it.

To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a prison with drops of water dripping over and over in it. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.

Hints

Since this kanji doesn't really have a meaning as much as it does a function, try to change the way you think about it when you're memorizing it.

Readings
On’yomi

None

Kun’yomi

のま

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
This symbol doesn't really have a name, but it's sometimes called the のま because it looks like the katakana characters ノ and マ put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way:

Your mom is the repeater. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling "No ma (のま)!" but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.

Hints

If you feel like you're so full you're about to burst, and if you imagine your mom doing this to you (how could you, ma?), you should be able to remember the reading of this kanji. That being said, the reading is mostly only useful in the event that you have to identify a 々 — otherwise, you won't see it much.

でん

Kun’yomi

た

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading た, we use the word "taco."

You're in the rice field... but when you lean down to examine the rice more closely, you see that it's not rice that's growing, it's a bunch of little tacos (た), blossoming out of the ground.

Hints

Smell the tacos. Touch the tacos. Taste the tacos. This is definitely a very strange rice field.

Please help me create a picture to help me remember the 右 Right kanji. It uses mnemonic technique.

右 Right

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
ナ Narwhal 口 Mouth

Meaning
Primary
Right

Mnemonic
Narwhal mouths are on the right side of their head. In fact, some people didn't think they had mouths at all because they weren't looking from the right. Rookie mistake.

See how the "mouth" radical is to the right of the "narwhal" radical? That should help you remember that this means right.

Hints

Imagine looking at a narwhal from the front. No mouth. Now look at it from the right. Mouth!

Readings
On’yomi

ゆう, う

Kun’yomi

みぎ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
How did we know to look from the right, though? Because the youths (ゆう) figured it out. Youths think in ways that older people usually don't. That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.

Hints

Imagine a bunch of youths walking in a group and looking at everything from the right. You remember when you were a youth and you used to look at everything from one side too.

Note: All the ゆう readings will use the word "youths" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these "youths" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world.

Mnemonic
Just imagine a beast with a lid for a head and fins for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number six is the devil's number.

Hints

Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (six), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.

Readings
On’yomi

ろく

Kun’yomi

む

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Whenever we need to remember the reading ろく we just use the word rock.

So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, rock (ろく) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.

Hints

Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji.

りつ, りゅう

Kun’yomi

た

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Think of someone who has to stand up straight for you. These people are pros in hospitality. These are the doormen at the Ritz (りつ).

Hints

Imagine the doormen being extra straight… too straight in their standing. On their uniform is “The Ritz” written in fine lettering, and as you walk past them, they stand up straight and say “Welcome to the Ritz!” Whatever you do, while you’re thinking about it, make sure you think about how they stand up so straight, and associate it with these doormen, who work, specifically, at the Ritz. If you effectively imagine all this, you should be able to remember this on’yomi. Go through it like it’s a movie in your head!

丁 Street

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
丁 Street

Hints

As long as you know the radical street, you know the kanji street.

Readings
On’yomi

ちょう, てい

Kun’yomi

None

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
So you're walking down this street, and off in the distance you see the silhouette of somebody. A lady. Big, black curly hair and red eyes. It is the street-woman, Mrs. Chou (ちょう).

Hints

Mrs. Chou is a character you'll see a lot throughout WaniKani, anytime the reading is ちょう like this one. A lore will develop around her, so the more vividly you can imagine your Mrs. Chou right now, the easier things will get later. In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a "street-woman" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless. She has a nice, middle-class home that's not outside of her financial means. What I'm saying is she wanders the streets looking for evil things to do. These are HER streets. So whenever you see the street radical, know that Mrs. Chou is probably going to show up!

Hints

The radical for this one is easy too, making the meaning for this kanji super easy as well!

Readings
On’yomi

にち, じつ

Kun’yomi

ひ, か, び

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
There are so many on'yomi for this kanji, but since this kanji is so important and common, you'll end up learning them all eventually whether you want to or not. For now, you're only going to have to learn one of the readings, and that one is にち.

The sun is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich Nietzsche (にち), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.

Hints

This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude. Imagine the sun totally pissed off, too. It makes a grunting noise as it builds up a sun beam to blast him off the face of the earth.

Also note that there's another reading worth learning as well: じつ. The reading can be remembered by thinking "Gee! Two readings?" Because, seriously, two readings? Too many...

刀 Sword

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
刀 Sword

Meaning
Primary
Sword

Alternative
Katana

Mnemonic
The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same! The radical is sword, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese sword? That's right, the most common is a katana, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.

Hints

This kanji also looks a lot like the kanji 力. To avoid getting them confused, remember that this one is missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword kanji is 90% of the power kanji).

Readings
On’yomi

とう

Kun’yomi

かたな

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
So now you have this sweet katana in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make whooshing noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to とうきょう (Tokyo). とうきょう has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to とうきょう.

Hints

Imagine trying to travel to とうきょう with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere.

Mnemonic
Remember the thousand people going down the slide on a cross in the radical 千? Turns out each one of them was carrying a thousand cents (せん). Go ahead and try to calculate what a thousand times a thousand cents would come out to. It's quite a lot, actually.

Hints

Problem is, as they all tumble down the slide the change falls out of their pockets, so there's a thousand times a thousand cents scattered all over on the floor under the slide.

すい

Kun’yomi

みず

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Imagine a lake (i.e. a whole bunch of water). When you think of water, you should try to think of this beautiful lake. It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire swing (すい). You get onto the tire swing and you are swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very sweet. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).

Hints

I know that was a long one, but try to imagine all the different bits. Try to feel the feelings (cold, smell, etc) too. The more you create in this fake memory (which you’re using to remember and associate water with すい (swing)) the more likely you are to end up remembering enough to make it happen. Especially when it comes to the senses part, the more vividly you imagined it, the more likely you are to remember the on’yomi.

Hints

If you can't remember the radical for writing, maybe you could try… writing it down?

Mnemonic
This kanji has more than one important reading you need to learn! But don't worry, here's a mnemonic to help you:

You always put writing on your buns (ぶん) to keep them from getting eaten by the bun monster (もん). What kind of writing? Usually it's just an X to show the monster these buns are off-limits. (In fact, it kind of looks like the X part in 文. Hmm…)

Hints

Imagine writing a big X (or even a big 文) on all your buns, then showing them to the bun monster. Watch as he turns and goes at the sight of the writing, all disappointed. Not today, bun monster.

円 Yen

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
冂 Head 亠 Lid

Meaning
Primary
Yen

Alternatives
Round, Circle

Mnemonic
Here we have a head with a lid in it, near the top. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of yen coins, the currency of Japan. Jackpot! And all those yen coins have a nice round shape, naturally.

Hints

This kanji can mean both "yen" and "round"! It's OK if you can't remember both meanings. But it might help to think about how round the yen coins are inside this person's head, which can also be pretty round…

Readings

えん

None

Mnemonic
What does the word yen sound like? It sounds like えん. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a "ye" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an "e" sound, which is why yen = えん!

Hints

Picture these round えん in your mind. Maybe look some up online too, just to be safe. See how round those yen (えん) are?
