Include excerpts of the mnemonic text throughout the image.

耳 Ear

Ear

This is the ear radical, since it looks like an ear. As much as a radical can, anyway. Those two middle lines are the ridges that guide the sound into your ear, and the lines that stick out to the right are where the ear attaches to your head.
If you think about it, ears are just eyes that see sound. Whoa, dude… That explains the eye (目) and ear (耳) radical resemblance. Just remember this one is "ear" because ears stick out, just like the lines sticking out of the side of this radical.

冖 Forehead
Primary
Forehead
Mnemonic

Also, don't confuse this for a roof. You know this is a forehead and not a roof because this doesn't have a cute little chimney sticking out of the top. Foreheads definitely don't have chimneys.

Leader
Mnemonic

Mnemonic

Then, it starts to become more and more clear, and you start saying "that can't be me. No way it's me..."

All of this treasure is kept in the king's home (ほう). He can't let other people see how much treasure he has, or they'll get mad. Or worse, ask him to share some with his people. Yuck. The treasure stays at home.

Hints

Picture his home from the outside. It looks like a normal, small castle. But then you walk in and it's a treasure trove of... well, treasure!

木 Tree 寸 Measurement

Meaning
Primary
Village

Mnemonic
Someone's taking tree measurements… Why are they taking measurements of trees? Because they're planning to cut them down to make their village.

Hints

There is a whole group of people out there who are measuring these trees. Imagine them asking each other "do you think this will be a good tree for our village center?" and other people nodding in agreement or disagreement as they measure.

Mnemonic
They take all the wood back to where they're building their village, and once they construct the village center they paint a mural (むら) on the side of it. The mural is of the forest where they got the trees from, to honor the village's origins.

Hints

Look at the mural on the side of this newly constructed village center. So many trees! Visualize the whole process of the tree becoming a building, as you reflect on the message of the mural.

世 World

Meaning
Primary
World

Alternative
Generation

Mnemonic
The world radical and the world kanji are the same, but there is another really important meaning you need to know: generation.

Think of it this way: the world is just made up of many different generations of people, plants, and animals all getting along together.

Hints

It's all these generational differences that make the world go 'round!

Mnemonic
It's your job to protect the world and every generation with your special saber (せい). It was given to you to uphold correctness, and you'll pass it on to the next generation when it's time. Then they'll watch out for the world when you're gone.

Hints

Hold the saber up high and pledge to protect the world for all of the generations to come! Then swish it around and make buzzing sounds with your mouth.

年 Year

𠂉 Gun 牛 Cow

Meaning
Primary
Year

Mnemonic
You have a gun and a cow, which must mean it's that time of the year! Every year on New Year's Eve, you get asked to shoot a cow, as per tradition. You really don't want to though, so you deliberately miss every time.

Hints

Last year was a close call and you ended up shooting the cow's horn, which is why the cow radical looks a little strange here. Can you see how the cow radical fits underneath the gun?

Readings

とし

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
It seems everyone has caught on to the fact that you deliberately miss every year, so this year you make a nendoroid (ねん) decoy in the shape of a cow.

Hints

Nendoroids are Japanese plastic figurines. (Look them up if you need to! And yes, there are cow nendoroids.) It probably won’t be easy to make a cow-sized nendoroid this year, but better than having to shoot a real one.
