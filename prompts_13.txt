木 Tree 羊 Sheep 水 Water

Meaning

Mnemonic
By a tree, there's a sheep in the water with a formal name ender. That means everyone calls him Sheep-sama. No one calls him just "Sheep," since he's kind of a big deal. He's actually like sheep royalty. When he's not in his castle, Sheep-sama enjoys playing in the water by the trees.

This can also mean manner, as in your manner of doing things. I guess someone with a formal name ender has a different manner of doing things.

羊 Sheep ハ Fins 良 Good

Meaning
Primary
Foster

Mnemonic
Sheep fins are good for foster children. The sheep have been genetically combined with fish, so the sheep have fins (and they've lost their tails — which is why the tail part of the sheep radical is missing in this kanji). These sheep fins are rich in nutrients, so they're good for fostering big, strong foster children.

Hints

Readings

Hints

Remember how bad those sheep fins tasted? Now imagine eating your favorite yogurt flavor instead. This yogurt is delicious.

If you tie a thread around Wolverine and dip him in water, he'll turn green, like the Hulk. Some kind of weird chemical reaction. But I… I wouldn't try it if I were you. You wouldn't like him when he's green.

Hints

Still, imagine pulling Wolverine from X-Men out of the water with that thread, and seeing him looking kinda green. Pretty green, but he could be greener. We have to go greener! We have to make the Hulk green with envy! So you put him back in the water, again and again…
