Rose Madder

Alternative
Deep Red

Mnemonic
What kind of flowers grow in the west? Rose madder flowers, of course. Don't know what those are? That's okay. Just know their roots are used to make dyes of a deep red color. Red like the rose in their name, but madder, wilder, deeper… And they grow in the west so they can take in those deep red colors of the setting sun.

Hints

Picture yourself sitting in the west as the red sun sets, smashing those little rose madder roots into a paste to make your deep red dyes. Your fingers turn red from the rose madder too.

As you smash the roots of the rose madder and stain your fingers a deep red, a little girl comes up to you and points. She says, "赤ね (あかね)?" (That's red, right?) You look down at the rose madder roots and your fingers, and nod. She's right, it is red. Deep red.

Hints

Hear the little girl say あかね while pointing at the rose madder and your deep red fingers. She's right. And the way she says it is so darn cute.

艹 Flowers 圣 Tombstone

Primary
Stem

When you leave flowers on a tombstone they look good at first, but after a few days or some harsh weather, there's nothing left but stems. That's why you have to replace flowers on tombstones all the time. If you don't it will look like you only left the stems there, and that's pretty disrespectful.

Hints

Imagine being in a graveyard looking at all the tombstones and seeing nothing but stems on all of them. All the pretty flowery parts have died and blown away.

Hints

Look at all the cookie covered tombstones. Now your bag is full of stems, but you can use them to make more cookies to bring back next time. Don't worry, nobody eats them. Stem cookies are probably poisonous.
