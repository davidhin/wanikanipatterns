River

Mnemonic
During a tsunami, your lip ring is ripped off while you’re trying to cross a river. There was no other path to safety, you had to cross the raging river, but you lost your footing and smashed your face on a rock and lost your lip ring.

Hints

Imagine how painful this would be, having your lip ring ripped from your lip. It would hurt a lot. Touch your lip and imagine missing half of it. Yikes.

こう, こお

Mnemonic
But why were you trying to cross this river anyway? Well your car (か) was on the other side of it, and you figured if you could get to your car you could outrun the tsunami and be safe. Too bad you fell and ripped out your lip ring though.

Hints

Imagine yourself fording the river, all wet and cold from the water. Keeping your eyes on your car, you move slowly across. Look at the car. Look at it!

貝 Shellfish 宀 Roof 丁 Street

Meaning
Primary
Savings

Mnemonic
You keep all of your shellfish under a roof down the street and it's your savings. Shellfish used to be used as money way back, and these aren't shellfish you're spending, they're ones you're saving up for later.

Hints

Imagine walking down the street to deposit more shellfish into your special savings and gaze happily at the huge pile you keep far enough away that you aren't tempted to spend it.

Readings

ちょ

Kun’yomi

た, たくわ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
When you want to withdraw from your savings you force yourself to use chopsticks (ちょ) to pick up the shellfish. They're especially slippery, hard to use chopsticks too, that way it's really hard to take too much out of your savings.

Hints

Imagine trying to lift up a shellfish with a pair of smooth chopsticks. It slips right out. Ugh! I guess that's good though, because it's a savings for a reason (you shouldn't be spending it)!

You show your sprain to a doctor, and he tells you to go see the Czar (ざ). In your country, only the Czar has the authority to treat a sprain of this severity.

You sneak around the tombstone to see what this suspicious soul is doing, and you realize it's pretending to kayak (かい). The soul is sitting behind the tombstone, in a small kayak, moving its arms like it's rowing through water.

Even more suspicious, the soul seems to be holding a kettle (け). Considering the soul is already dead, this doesn't seem like something it will need.

Hints

Picture a suspicious, kettle holding, kayaking soul. The afterlife may be more interesting than you thought.

Hints

Imagine the helplessness you'd feel facing him. Your master, who all along was a kind of plastic figurine called a nendoroid, is impervious to the twist technique he himself taught you! What a twist.
