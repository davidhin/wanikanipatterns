Pottery

Mnemonic
The only type of can you'll be building in prison is one made of pottery. Do you honestly think they would let you have anything made of metal or plastic? No, too dangerous. You have to make all of your cans and plates and underpants the old-fashioned pottery way.

Hints

Picture the first piece of pottery you ever made. Feel it in your hands. At least you've learned something new while you've been stuck in prison.
