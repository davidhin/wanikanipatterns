Imagine this radiance emanating from your shiny dome. The radiance is blinding!

而 Rake 寸 Measurement

Meaning
Primary
Resistant

Mnemonic
You take a rake in for a measurement but it is resistant. The rake doesn’t want to have its measurements taken. The rake is resistant to have any measurement taken because it feels inferior to the other rakes and doesn’t want to be embarrassed if it ends up being smaller than the others.

Try and move this rake over to the measurement table. It is resistant so you have a hard time moving it. Imagine the rake struggling and resisting endlessly.
