Hints

Make sure you get to the point where you pull this anti-social guy's beard off, to reveal Han Solo beneath. Be surprised... not just because he's Han Solo, but because he's real, too! Maybe you can yell out "Han! Your people need you!"

If you can get to CLOAK YOU, then you can get to きょく much easier than just trying to get there from scratch. So imagine working in this bureau and getting to cloak yourself all the time.

Feel a little frustrated you can't find ice. Have the words "next next next" echoing through your head as you go from store to store, irritated.

Readings

Mnemonic
To remember the reading じ, we used the word "Jesus" - Finally, when you're at the last store in existence, you decide it's time to pray to Jesus (じ), asking for a miracle. He comes down from the heavens with ice in his hands.

Hints

Imagine him coming down. Imagine your surprise. He hands you the ice, and it's cold. You thank him, and he flies away.

番 Number In A Series

釆 Sickle 田 Rice Paddy

Meaning
Primary
Number In A Series

Alternative
Turn

Mnemonic
You have to sickle the rice paddy today because it's your turn. This kanji also means number in a series, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.

Hints

Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with.

It will be helpful to remember both the "number in a series" and "turn" meanings for the vocab coming up in the future.

Mnemonic
This turn-based rice sickle system is a contest as well! But, you are disappointed to find out that you have been banned (ばん) from the game because of the performance enhancing steroids you've been taking.

Hints

Try to feel disappointed by this. Strange thing to feel disappointed by, but you were a great sickler. You were going to win the great prize, too (come up with something huge!), but now you're banned for the season.

When a bunch of threads are meeting on paper (after you've dipped them in paint, say) they can create a masterpiece of a picture (or painting).

也 Alligator 氵 Tsunami

Meaning
Primary
Pond

Mnemonic
The poor alligator was taken far inland by a tsunami. Now his only source of water is a tiny pond that barely fits his body, and doesn't even provide much food.

Hints

Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately.

Readings
On’yomi

ち

Kun’yomi

いけ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
The worst part about this pond is that the only thing for the alligator to eat is cheese (ち). Cheese may be yummy for humans, but alligators hate it. They'd rather eat the cow the cheese came from. Sadly, this pond is full of cheese.

Hints

Picture an alligator crying in a pond full of cheese. It's eating a piece really slowly and weeping.

⻌ Scooter 首 Neck

To remember the reading どう we use the word "doughnut."

You're traveling down this road so fast that you don't see the giant doughnut (どう) that's rolling toward you until the last minute. You crash into it, and both you and the doughnut go tumbling down. Ahg, your neck!

Mnemonic
You loiter around with a weapon because you're currently doing your service and duty to your country. You're standing guard outside, waiting just in case something will happen.

Mnemonic
You're about halfway through your service, when a yak (やく) walks by. It stops directly in front of you and grunts. "Excuse me, Mr. Yak, but it's my duty to escort you away from my country."

Hints

Somehow your duty has become pushing this stubborn, hairy yak away from the entrance to your country. You poke it in the butt with your weapon, but it doesn't seem to care.

A stone lantern is an excellent way to sharpen anything, even in the dark. Your knives, your forks, your spoons, and even your sword.

Readings
On’yomi

けん

Kun’yomi

と

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Why did you sharpen your blade? Because you are about to do battle with Ken (けん), the famous samurai warrior.

Hints

You'll want to remember this character, because he will come up many times throughout your WaniKani journey. Ken the samurai used to work for WaniKani, but then he went rogue because he thought WaniKani wasn't being radical enough. So now he wanders the website carrying his squid friend (who you'll meet later) in a bucket.

To help you visualize him, imagine a samurai with armor made from crab shells, a helmet that is just an alligator head, and swords with crab claw hand guards. His great beard and mustache are styled in the shape of whatever kanji is giving you the most trouble at the time.

自 Self 丿 Slide

Meaning
Primary
Somebody

Alternatives
Someone, Body

Mnemonic
The self radical is a bit modified, with things sticking out, but that’s because it’s falling down a slide.

Sure, it’s yourself who’s tumbling down the slide… at least that’s how it feels to you. Who are you? What are you? All you know is you’re somebody, but you don’t know who that somebody is.

Hints

Apparently, you’re having some kind of internal crisis. Come up with a rough one and you’ll remember this kanji better.

Readings
On’yomi

しん

Kun’yomi

み

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
You’re falling down this metaphorical slide… And then you hit somebody… and you hit them really hard. On your metaphorical shin (しん). You split it in half and it’s at a right angle. The pain is incredible (shins have a lot of nerves!). It may have been broken, and you may not be able to walk correctly again… metaphorically speaking, that is.

Hints

Just make the shin hit as painful as possible in your imagination and you’ll surely remember this kanji’s on’yomi.

耂 Coffin 日 Sun

Meaning
Primary
Someone

Alternative
Somebody

Mnemonic
A coffin has been left out in the sun for too long. When dead bodies are out in the sun like this, they really begin to decompose. You are wondering who this person is, though. You can't tell because it's fallen apart too much. You look on the coffin. There's a label, but it only says "someone."

Hints

Smell the stench of the decomposing body. Also, feel really curious as to who this person is. It came from somewhere that gives you a reason to believe it's someone you know. Then, feel the disappointment as you read the label that says "someone" instead of an actual name. "Someone," you repeat. "Someone."

Readings
On’yomi

しゃ

Kun’yomi

もの

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the sound しゃ we use "shaman."

It's time you open the coffin and check. Maybe there's more answers in there. There's no way this person could just be "someone." You lift the lid, and sure enough, you're able to figure out who it is. It's a shaman (しゃ), dressed in full shaman garb.

Hints

How strange that a shaman was delivered to you this way! Come up with a story explaining why this shaman's body is here at your door, rotting in the sun. Make it ridiculous and interesting so you remember it.

支 Branch

Meaning
Primary
Support

Alternative
Branch

Mnemonic
The branch radical and the branch kanji are the same! This kanji also means support. To remember it, think about a tree with lots of branches. The branches support each other and the trunk of the tree. If you were to climb the tree, the branches would be able to support your weight too!

Hints

Picture a branch supporting the weight of you, your entire family, and maybe a few friends.

Readings
On’yomi

し

Kun’yomi

ささ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
You're happily sitting on this branch, letting it support all this weight, when a sheep (し) starts to climb the tree. A very, very big sheep. Uh oh... no no, sheep. If you get on this branch it won't be able to support all this weight!!!

Hints

The big sheep walks up the side of the tree with its weird hooves and starts to put its weight on the branch. "No no no!" you and your whole family scream. The branch can't support the weight of the sheep. It snaps! You all tumble to the ground.

The end.

Meaning
Primary
Talk

Alternative
Speak

Mnemonic
Say it with your tongue. If you do, you'll be able to talk. You'll be able to speak.

Readings

わ

はな, はなし

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
If something uses their tongue, it will be able to talk and speak. To prove this, you teach a walrus (わ) to use its tongue, and lo and behold, it speaks to you!

Hints

You decided to teach a walrus how to speak because it seemed like the hardest thing to teach, with its tusks and all that. It turned out to be really easy. Although, you may have picked the Justin Long walrus, by accident. Either way, this walrus can speak! And you definitely (probably) helped.

投 Throw

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
扌 Fingers 殳 Weapon

Meaning
Primary
Throw

Mnemonic
In your fingers is a weapon, so you throw it. Maybe you're angry and you threw the weapon at a person you don't like. Maybe you're a pacifist and you threw it away so no one else could use it. Either way, when you have a weapon in your fingers you have to throw it.

Hints

Imagine a weapon in between your fingers. It doesn't matter what kind. Now feel the weight as you throw it.

Readings
On’yomi

とう

Kun’yomi

Mnemonic
You throw your weapon away because you're about to enter とうきょう and there are no weapons allowed there. There is, however, a big pile of thrown away weapons by the border, which is where you're throwing yours right now.

Hints

文 Writing 寸 Measurement

Meaning
Primary
Versus

Alternative
Opposite

Mnemonic
Writing and measurement stand versus one another. Writing is all about feeling and expression. Measurement is about cold hard numbers. Yep, in this world writing people are basically the opposite of measurement people. Which side are you on?

Hints

What's that, you say? It doesn't always have to be writing types versus measurement types? We can work together to create a better society? Nah, sorry, I'd rather it be me versus the world.

Readings
On’yomi

たい

Kun’yomi

None

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Whenever it's you versus someone else, you wear a tie (たい). Naturally, your tie is always the opposite color of your opponent's tie. Kinda like how political rivals wear different color ties when they debate. It's pretty silly, but at least your tie makes it clear that it's you versus them.

Hints

Think of someone you know who's your total opposite. Now imagine you're both in ties, but opposite colors, and you're debating… or fighting in a cage match or something.
