The cloud floating above a demon has its soul in it. If you can manage to get through to the demon, to make it see that it doesn't have to be evil, it might remember who it is and return to the spirit it once was.

Hints

Right now, however, the demon is looming over you, and you can't see anything in the cloud above its head. It just looks mad, like it's gonna pummel you or eat you.

You shout out and beg its soul for help until, finally, you see the cloud take the shape of a condor (こん). Aha! "You were a condor before you became a demon! Remember who you are and turn back!"

Hints

POOF! Now there's a condor spirit floating in front of you, crying. "Thank you, human. You've saved my soul!" it says, and float/flies off and disappears.
