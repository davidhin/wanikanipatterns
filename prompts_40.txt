Taking a cross with a drop on it, you walk through the rice paddy in the direction of winter and spread your arms wide. You spread your arms to halt the approach of winter because your rice paddy is not done growing yet. You take the cross with you for some extra religious power of persuasion, and the drop in case any of that rice is thirsty.

Hints

Imagine facing the direction of the approaching winter while facing away from the rice paddy. Feel the weight of the cross in your hands as you spread your arms and implore the winter to hold off on its arrival. Drip the drop onto any thirsty rice.

Kun’yomi

しき, し

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
With your arms spread like that, you look extremely chic (しき). Spread arms are obviously a chic posture, and the fact that you're holding a cross makes it even more chic.

Side note: The official kun'yomi reading is just し, but since far more words use しき, we're focusing on that here. Even though the き part is technically okurigana, it's actually used in the readings for most of the compounds that use this kanji!

Hints

Feel the strain on your chic arms as you continue to spread them. Since you're by far the most chic person around, you have to set a good example for your people, so don't let them (or your arms) down.
