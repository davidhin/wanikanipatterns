矢 Arrow

Meaning

し

Kun’yomi

や

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading や we use the word “Yankees” (like the evil baseball team, go M’s!).

What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the Yankee (や) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what its “move” is).

Hints

Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though. Strangely, it’s able to walk around even though it's an arrow. It has some kind of agenda. Make it a bit evil, if you can. What a strange thing…

Mnemonic
Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You cut them into pairs, and give sets (せつ) to everyone who needs them in the village.

Hints

Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in sets, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.

小 Small 丿 Slide

Meaning
Primary
Few

Alternative
A Little

Mnemonic
You have a small slide. The thing about small slides is that few people can use them. Not everyone can fit their bum in a small slide — only a few small ones can make it down.

Hints

Readings
On’yomi

しょう

Kun’yomi

すこ, すく

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Another reason so few people can use it is that the Shogun (しょう) is trying to go down the slide. We're talking a grown man who's way too big for this little slide, so a few people have to wait behind him — it's a slide traffic jam.

Hints

Imagine this in your head. Even the few people who fit on the slide are struggling to get past the Shogun. Meanwhile the Japanese secret service is trying to make sure no one gets close to the shogun while he slides. A few people are crying. They want to slide, they want to leave… It's chaos.

もう

Kun’yomi

け

Nanori

Mnemonic
With fur, whisk your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it's fur). You're surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel and smell like? Now it's time to get rid of it. There's just too much hair! To get rid of it, you'll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they're loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think "fur → in the fur → get rid of the fur → mow the fur," in that order. That'll get you to "mow," which will help you to remember the on’yomi.

Hints

Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.
