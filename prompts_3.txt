矢 Arrow
Primary
Arrow
Mnemonic
This is a gun on top of a big person. The gun is big too, obviously. Why is this big guy's gun so big? Because it shoots arrows! Bullets are pretty small, so the guns that shoot them can be any size. But you need a big gun if you want to shoot a big arrow, right? That's why this is the radical for arrow.

Door
Mnemonic
This one looks like a flag, but don't be fooled — it's got a line over the top of it, kind of like a door frame. That makes this a little door. Specifically a swinging door, with the vertical line on the left being its door hinge. Kind of a weird door, it's true, but you can see it, right?

父 Father
Primary
Father
Mnemonic
This is the father radical, since you can see a very fatherly face in it — two droopy eyes at the top, a big nose in the middle, and a mustache flaring out at the bottom. Sort of a generic older gentleman father-type face, isn't it?

This is also a lot like the hand radical (手) but smaller. And what are the smaller parts of a hand? The fingers! You can remember it that way too, if you want.

心 Heart

Heart
Mnemonic
Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a heart. Not the heart emoji kind, but a real-deal beating heart. Basically, there's a lump in the middle (the heart), and three lines that make up the arteries. Okay, so it's not the most anatomically correct heart, but just look at those floppy arteries going in and out, doing their thing and keeping you alive. What's not to love?

Primary
Poop
Mnemonic
For better or worse, this looks enough like the poop emoji (💩) to make this the poop radical. Try to remember it for its distinct outline. If it helps you can also note the private radical on the bottom of this one, since you should probably be in private when you poop…

石 Stone
Primary
Stone
Mnemonic
A leaf growing out of a… mouth?? Look again and see the mouth is actually made of stone. The leaf here was just growing out of a crack on the side. Makes this stone mouth sculpture look kinda elegant, if you ask me. And obviously leaves don't grow on mouths, so whenever you see a leaf on a mouth, remember it's gotta be stone.

毋 Window
Primary
Window
Mnemonic
See the criss-cross in the almost-square shape? That's the frames of a big window you can look out of. It's not perfectly shaped like a rice field, it's more artistic. That's why this is a window and 田 is not.

Readings
On’yomi

し

Kun’yomi

や

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading や we use the word “Yankees” (like the evil baseball team, go M’s!).

What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the Yankee (や) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what its “move” is).

Hints

Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though. Strangely, it’s able to walk around even though it's an arrow. It has some kind of agenda. Make it a bit evil, if you can. What a strange thing…

This city must have a lot of sheep (し) because, besides the manhole lid and the towel, all you can see are sheep. There are sheep everywhere. It's a sheep city.

Hints

If you have seven swords, there's only so much you can do with them. The main thing? Probably using them to cut something.

Readings

せつ

Kun’yomi

き

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You cut them into pairs, and give sets (せつ) to everyone who needs them in the village.

Hints

Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in sets, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.

小 Small 丿 Slide

Meaning
Primary
Few

Alternative
A Little

Mnemonic
You have a small slide. The thing about small slides is that few people can use them. Not everyone can fit their bum in a small slide — only a few small ones can make it down.

Hints

Imagine a small slide (how could you not, after you see the radicals?). So few people can use this thing, really, but there are a few little ones who can fit on it at least.

Readings
On’yomi

しょう

Kun’yomi

すこ, すく

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Another reason so few people can use it is that the Shogun (しょう) is trying to go down the slide. We're talking a grown man who's way too big for this little slide, so a few people have to wait behind him — it's a slide traffic jam.

Hints

Imagine this in your head. Even the few people who fit on the slide are struggling to get past the Shogun. Meanwhile the Japanese secret service is trying to make sure no one gets close to the shogun while he slides. A few people are crying. They want to slide, they want to leave… It's chaos.

Readings
On’yomi

もう

Kun’yomi

け

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
With fur, whisk your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it's fur). You're surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel and smell like? Now it's time to get rid of it. There's just too much hair! To get rid of it, you'll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they're loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think "fur → in the fur → get rid of the fur → mow the fur," in that order. That'll get you to "mow," which will help you to remember the on’yomi.

Hints

Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.
