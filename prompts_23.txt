そく

のっと

Mnemonic
The first rule the shellfish enacts is that all humans take off their socks (そく) and give them to him. Hmm... is this some kind of nasty shellfish? Who would want socks?

Hints

Once everyone follows the rule, and the shellfish is on top of a pile of socks, he cackles, "It's easier to stab your toes with my knife now! Let's get to more rules!"

木 Tree 月 Moon

Meaning
Primary
Shelf

Mnemonic
Take a tree and make two moon-shaped shelf units with it. Moon radical-shaped, that is. Those moon radicals standing side by side kinda look like a shelf, don't you think? The tree on the left is just there to remind you it's made of wood, I guess. A lovely wooden shelf.

Hints

Imagine having some tall, moon radical-shaped shelves in your house. Where would you put them? Picture them there now. Honestly, they'd actually look pretty sophisticated.

Readings

ほう

Kun’yomi

たな

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To match the moon radical shape, this would have to be a pretty tall shelf, meaning you can store a ton-a-stuff (たな) on it.

Hints

Think about the ton-a-stuff you're going to put on this tall shelf. Like, literally measure out a ton of things and put them on there. It can hold it, I'm sure…

Mnemonic
Give that hole one last big stab, now you've totes (とつ) showed that hole who's boss. What did I tell you about the sudden thrust technique? It's totes super effective. Like, totes.

Hints

Remember "totes," that slang word for "totally"? It fell out of use almost as sudden as it appeared. Now it totes gives me a little stab of nostalgia whenever I hear it.

Mnemonic
These wacky dreams are only standard fare in June (じゅん) though. You don’t have them any other time of the year, just in June. You don’t know why June is the only time you have dreams about tsunami riding turkeys, but that’s just the way it is.

Hints

It’s usually pretty toasty in the month of June (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least) so imagine going to bed in this heat. Feel the spray of the refreshing tsunami water in your dream as the turkey continues to ride those tsunami waves with his cross.

Mnemonic
You have a bow and you want to make it long. To do that, you'd naturally just stretch it.

は

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
As you stretch the bow, you hear someone running at you. "That's my bow you're stretching!" yells Mrs. Chou (ちょう). She is not happy that you're stretching her things. You should probably try to un-stretch it, put it down, and run before she beats you.

Hints

Now Mrs. Chou is hitting you with the stretched out bow. You cry and apologize, but she won't listen. "I'm going to stretch you, like you stretched my bow," she says. Then she does it.

Meaning
Primary
Superior

Gentle

Mnemonic
The leader of a hundred foreheads in the heart of winter is superior at being gentle. These hundred foreheads are sensitive, especially in the heart of winter, so the leader must be very gentle. Not just any kind of gentle though—the superior kind of gentle that will keep a hundred foreheads following.

Hints

As a leader, you are superior. You’re so gentle to these foreheads. See yourself caring for them in the winter. Feel the chill in the air as you wrap the foreheads in blankets and prepare heating pads for them.

Readings

ゆう

Kun’yomi

やさ, すぐ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
You need to be superior because all of these foreheads belong to youths (ゆう). They don't know how to take care of themselves, though they try to convince you they can. They're too young to know any better.

Hints

Picture the youths trying to show you that they are the superior ones, then they sneeze, their eyes fill with tears, and you have to gently tuck them back into bed. Silly youths.

Hints

Your teacher assures you this wet sheep is far less dangerous to clean up after than a wet bear. They're the expert, so you should listen and wipe up after that sheep.

Alternative
Ability

Mnemonic
In the morning, if you want your hat to dry, you need to hang it on a tree trunk. In the morning, everything is covered in dew. The grass is wet, the leaves are wet, but the tree trunk isn't wet! It was protected by the rest of the tree, so you can hang your hat there to dry.

Hints
