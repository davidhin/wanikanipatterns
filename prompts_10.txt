How does the fish lure maker test his newly finished lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a row (りょう) boat and rows out into the sea.

Hints

Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji.

豆 Beans 頁 Geoduck

Meaning
Primary
Head

Mnemonic
If you feed a lot of beans to a geoduck, its head will grow larger. To a geoduck, beans are a brain food, so by eating beans, it can grow an incredibly large head. Geoducks already look strange enough as it is, let alone with engorged heads.

Hints

Imagine, if you will, a geoduck. Now imagine it with a massive head. It looks ridiculous, and more disgusting than ever. It's actually really creeping you out, because the head keeps getting larger as the geoduck eats more beans. Ew.

Mnemonic
As the geoduck eats more and more beans its head gets bigger and bigger, until finally the head explodes like an atomic (あたま) bomb. BOOM! Geoduck parts go flying everywhere and pieces of its massive head float to the ground as atomic fallout.

Hints

Remember how gross geoducks are? Of course you do. Now imagine one exploding its atomic head right in front of you. You've got geoduck mess all over yourself. It's gross, slimy, sticky, and covering you from head to toe. It's wretched.

Mnemonic
If you go up to a gate and press your ear to it, you'll hear what's going on on the other side. The people on the other side will have no idea you can hear their conversation.

Hints

I'm sure you've pressed your ear up against a wall, door, or gate before to hear what's going on on the other side. Remember back to a time you did this and how sneaky you felt listening in on people without them knowing. You sneaky frood, you.

From the other side of the gate, you hear one of the people start to play a song on a recorder. You recognize the song as "Hot Cross Buns (ぶん)." You haven't heard this song since grade school. "Hot cross buns, hot cross buns~"

Hints

I'm sure many of you were forced to play "Hot Cross Buns" on the recorder in school at some point. Picture yourself playing this song and remember the melody when you see this kanji.

Institution

Mnemonic
This building has a roof and will teach you about the origin of many things. It's an institution!

言 Say 周 Circumference

Meaning
Primary
Investigate

Alternative
Tone

Mnemonic
You say something about the circumference of this area. You've looked around this whole area, making a big circle around it, because you are trying to investigate something that happened here. You also say this thing in a really quiet tone of voice, because you don't want the person or thing you're investigating to know you're on to them.

Hints

Because the radical circumference is in play, you can think of the crime scene you're investigating as a statue of a giant globe, and you're doing a circumference around it. Then, in the reading, we'll think about what you'll say.

Mnemonic
You look at some gold and notice a fault in it. You scrape at the fault and see that it's just sprayed with gold paint. It's not gold, it's (comparatively) worthless iron!

If you don’t know about Tetsuo the Iron Man, you should definitely look it up (if you aren't averse to horror/violent films). Tetsuo is one of the most insane movies in the history of ever.

Hints

Watch a trailer on YouTube for Tetsuo the Iron Man. Go ahead, do it now – I’ll wait. Did you watch it? Remember that nonsense every time you see this kanji.

Mnemonic
What you say between five mouths is a language. As long as there are five different people saying these same words with their five mouths, it's considered its own language.

Another mouth joins in speaking the language, but it's green and scaled and... it's Godzilla's (ご) mouth! Godzilla speaks this language too.

Hints

Godzilla speaks a language some people understand! You wish you knew this earlier, then you might have been able to stop some of his destruction. Try to say, "Hey Godzilla, please stop destroying my city," in his language. It's a lot of growling and yelling. He doesn't seem to understand you. You better practice your pronunciation.

車 Car 圣 Tombstone

Alternatives
Light, Light Weight

Mnemonic
For a car, a tombstone is lightweight. Cars are very strong, you see, so something heavy like a tombstone is no match for them. All cars find tombstones to be light and easy to transport.

Hints

Picture yourself trying to move a huge slab tombstone. It’s difficult, no? I bet you wish you had a car or some other vehicle to make the process much less painful. Your arms are getting sore from carrying the tombstone and you’re getting sweaty and hot from all the work. What you would do for a car with air conditioning.

What do you wish you had to transport this tombstone? Oh, that’s right, a car. So you need some kind of car loophole (かる). If you had a car, this tombstone moving business would be no problem. To cars, tombstones are naught but lightweight pebbles! But the rules say you can't use cars to carry tombstones, so you need to find a car loophole.

Hints

Remember all that hard work you were doing before and how you got all sweaty and gross? Now imagine yourself inside of a nice car with air conditioning, and the tombstone in the trunk. It feels great doesn’t it? The air conditioning is perfect, and driving a car is much easier than carrying a tombstone around. Thank goodness you found a car loophole in the tombstone carrying rules.

Let the sun shine into your ear while sitting on a stool and make sure most of it gets in your head. You want to fill your brain with the most sun anyone ever has.

Most of this is for your cyborg (さい). You're testing out a new way to power it, but if you can't get most of the sun into your ear, it won't be enough to power most of the cyborg's robo-parts.

Hints

Install the part into your cyborg. As long as most of the sun gets into its human ear, most of its cyborg bits will have power.

Standing under the tree, you go to give your parent a big hug, but you manage to bang your shin (しん)  on a huge tree root. Your parent pulls you in for a warm hug and rubs your shin. Despite the pain, it becomes an unforgettable "shin-timate" moment.

Hints

Busting your shins on things really hurts. I'm sure you've hit your shins on coffee tables and the like all your life. Remember that pain and think how much worse it would be banging your bare shins on pointy tree roots just when you were enjoying a moment of parental intimacy. Not enjoyable.

Hints

How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become こういちs. One mother こういち--pushing a baby こういち--looks up and stares at your fins. Now you remember why you never go out in public.

車 Car 云 Cloud

Meaning

Hints

Picture this as your life. You could explode at any moment, you’re sick, and you have B.O. Nobody wants to be around you because you might explode and kill them, and you stink. What a terrible way to live!

Alternatives
Direct, Fix

Mnemonic

It can also mean direct, because when you go straight to a place, you're going there directly. Depending on the context it can even mean fix, since fixing something means straightening out all the messed up crooked bits.

Hints

Here's some straight talk for ya: if you study your radicals, you'll have no problem with this one.

Mnemonic
Put food straight into your esophagus without chewing and you will choke (ちょく). You want to get straight to the most important part of eating — the digesting part — but if you don't follow all the intermediate steps, you'll end up choking.

Hints

Imagine shoving food straight down your esophagus and choking as you do. Why would you do this to yourself?!

Meaning
Primary
Wake Up

Mnemonic
Run into oneself in a dream and you'll definitely wake up.

Hints

If you run into yourself, it really messes you up, you know? You won't be able to handle what you're seeing so you have to wake up.

Readings

None

Mnemonic
If one runs into oneself and you don't wake up, just look down at your waist. If you're wearing an obi (お) you know it's a dream and you'll eventually wake up. If you aren't wearing an obi then it isn't a dream and you don't have anything to wake up from.

Hints

Your obi is like a special object you only have in dreams. If you have your obi, it's okay, it's a dream and you can wake up now! Make sure you memorize exactly how it feels so dream-you can't trick you or something.
