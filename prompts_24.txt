Put On

Mnemonic
You have a cross for a drunkard's car, to place on its dashboard. Drunkards should not drive, and when you put on a cross, it prevents the car from starting!

Hints

Imagine the power that starts emanating from the cross once it’s placed on the car, it can’t move even an inch. Nope, it's not going anywhere until its owner sobers up.

Hints

Picture your cyborg, approaching a drunkard's car to place a cross on it. You see it open a big compartment on its chest, and it's filled with crosses.

Hints

Imagine how warm your waist would be if you stuffed a bunch of 子 sheep into your waistband. Just don't let anyone see you do it. Pretty sure that's animal cruelty…
