You turn in your paragraph, and it is given to Emperor こういち, who insists on being involved in all construction projects. Surprisingly, he approves your construction project, thanks to that paragraph you wrote in the application.

Hints

In that paragraph, you praised こういち for being a great emperor, and you said that this construction project would help you to have more time to do your WaniKani reviews. Clearly you were pandering to Emperor こういち when you wrote it. But hey, it worked!

Hint: When you see 工 in a kanji it will often take the こう reading.

非 Criminal 文 Writing

Meaning
Primary
Patterned

Mnemonic
Criminal writing is always patterned. That is to say, there is a pattern to it, lots of ARGS and GONNA STAB YAs, but it's also patterned beautifully, with a collage of cut out letters.

Hints

Can you see the patterns in the writing this criminal did? It looks like a quilt or some plaid. It's almost beautiful, the way those death threats are arranged!

Mnemonic
As you look closer at the patterned writing you realize that it forms the shape of an eagle (い). The most American bird of them all! Maybe this guy isn't a criminal after all!

Hints

Picture an eagle patterned out of cut out letters. What the words say isn't important (though it is asking for a ransom on your grandma), but the underlying image is gorgeous.

阝 Building 夂 Winter 生 Life

Meaning
Primary
Prosperity

Mnemonic
A building in winter will allow life to have prosperity. Before we had buildings it was impossible to have any prosperity in winter because everything was cold and most of us died.

This prosperity isn't good for everyone though. You look over and see Ryu (りゅう) from Street Fighter sitting in the corner. He's got everything he could ask for. He's won the tournament, he's got money, he's got this nice big building, but now he's depressed.

Hints

Ryu's prosperity has made him realize that having things isn't always enough. Now he's looking wistfully outside at the winter weather, missing the rough times.

禾 Grain ⺤ Cleat 旧 Former

Meaning
Primary
Rice Plant

Mnemonic
The grain stuck in your cleat had a former life. In that life it was a rice plant. It was a happy little rice plant, minding its own business, when it was yanked up, cleaned, and put in a bag for people to buy and cook and eat. That was so long ago. Now all that's left is this sad loose grain in the bottom of your shoe.

Hints

When you look at a grain of rice, you should think about how it used to be a rice plant. That rice plant had a family! いいね, you think — that rice plant had a good life.

いね, いな

Mnemonic
The grain of rice thinks about its former life as a rice plant and, like you, mutters "いね." What's that, little rice grain? Are you trying to say life was good?

Hints

As it reminisces it wants to say "good," but the いいね is tragically cut short… much like the rice plant's life. It doesn't even have the strength to say it properly, it has to say いね. Yes, little grain, your rice plant life really was いね. Because you… were an いね. I'm sorry.

Mnemonic
The aforementioned void has opened up in Little Kyoto (きょ). The spiked void tigers chose to come here in order to face off against the Hanshin Tigers baseball team in battle. It will be a vicious match here in Little Kyoto. Since this is taking place in Little Kyoto and not Japan itself, the Hanshin Tigers won't have the home field advantage. Who will win?

Hints

Picture this grand match taking place in Little Kyoto. Actual tigers versus the Hanshin Tigers. It’s truly a sight to behold. The void tigers are armed with their spikes and the Hanshin Tigers are armed with their bats. Hear the crack of wood and the roar of tigers in the air as the battle commences.

If you've ever been on welfare you probably already know about the sheep.
