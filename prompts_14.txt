Seasons

Mnemonic
A grain's child will grow with the seasons. In spring the grain is born, it grows in summer, is harvested in fall, and dies in winter.

Hints

Watch the grain children live their entire lives throughout the seasons. Though there are 72 seasons in Japan, so the life of a grain is actually really long there.

木 Tree 各 Kiss

Meaning
Primary
Status

Mnemonic
If a tree wants to kiss you, it's a sign of your status. Only someone of high status would be worthy enough to receive the gnarly but gentle kiss of a tree. Trees don't kiss just anyone, you know.

Hints

Imagine kissing a tree. Better yet, go kiss a tree. If you're lucky, it'll give you a little taste of sap — an even surer sign of your status.

Mnemonic
The best way to convince a tree of your status is to say "cock-a-doodle-doo" at it, like a cock (かく), i.e. a male chicken. Trees really place a lot of status on the ability to sound like a cock crowing.

Hints

Probably because a cock crowing means the sun's about to come up. Morning light is basically tree breakfast, after all, and they say the way to a tree's heart is through its chloroplasts. So picture yourself as a cock, cock-a-doodle-doing to a tree about your status.

One animal that is particularly  good is the wolf. Wolves have a bad reputation, but actually they're very, very good animals.

Also, wolves take care of wild, abandoned kids. Only wolves do that, because they're good. Just ask Mowgli!
