Kun’yomi

すべ, まった

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
But, as you're going through all the kings, it turns out not all of them have hats after all. The last one you come to is hatless. He's the king of Zen (ぜん). He has simple clothes and a shaved head, unlike all the other fancy kings standing around nearby.

Hints

To add to this story and make it more memorable, you can imagine the other kings getting upset, saying things like "All kings must wear hats! You are no king!" The king of Zen Buddhism just ignores them and begins to meditate.

けつ

Kun’yomi

ち

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
To remember the reading けつ, we use the word "ketsup." The perfect mix of ketchup and catsup!

The radical is technically blood, but you know that radical is just a drop (of blood) on a plate. So, you ask yourself... Is that really blood on the plate? Could it be? You decide to take a gamble and lick it off. When you taste it, it's definitely not blood. No, it's ketsup (けつ).

Hints

Feel the relief that you didn't just lick up someone's blood. Taste the ketsup taste, too. It's pretty good. Not quite ketchup, but not quite catsup. Yum!

一 Ground 冂 Head 山 Mountain

Meaning
Primary
Both

Mnemonic
As you dig under the ground you discover a head resting near a mountain, which are both strange things to find beneath the earth.

Hints

You'll want to focus on the part where you find both, not so much the things themselves. Think about how you can't believe you did so well finding both things at once. Usually you only find one or the other when you're searching.

Readings
On’yomi

Mnemonic
But, you dig too deep and water flows into where you are. Your only hope is a row (りょう) boat floating off in the distance.

Then, this hero of yours takes their spoon and says some magic words into it, changing it into a car (か).

Hints

Of course, doing something like this is utterly amazing. Feel amazed in your imagination, because if you don't, then it'll be hard to remember the reading for this kanji. If you are amazed, you'll know that spoons going to cars = the reading is か, so make sure you take the time to be amazed.

ち, じ

Kun’yomi

The only way to keep this dirt alligator from dragging you under the earth and eating you is to feed it cheese (ち). That way it won't lead you to a horrific death under the earth by dragging you under and spinning you around until you eat dirt (literally).

Mnemonic
There are some horns on the ground and a moon knife in front of you. When you try to move, they always rotate around with you, staying right in front. You can't escape these objects, for some reason.

This kanji means before too. Something that's in front of you is before you, after all.

Hints

Perhaps it's some kind of magic, but you don't care. Why are these strange objects always in front of me? Why won't they stay put? This will get pretty freaky after a while. Try to run. Try to hide. Spin around. Do whatever you need to do. No matter what, these objects are always in front.

Mnemonic
Your private grains are meant to stay private! You shouldn't be sharing them with the whole town, they're just for you.

This kanji also means I. Why? Because what's more private than you? I mean, I! Basically, some things are only the business of you (I) and those things should be private.

長 Long

Meaning
Primary
Long

Alternative
Leader

Mnemonic
The long radical and the long kanji are the same!

This kanji also means leader, because the longer a person is, the better a leader they'll be. Or maybe it was... the longer they've been somewhere? Whatever, longness = leaderness, you know?

Hints

Long isn't an idea that's easy to imagine in any specific sense, but you can try some other things too, as long as it gets associated with Mrs. Chou. For the most part, when you see a kanji with the radical 長 the reading will be ちょう.

Mnemonic
A tsunami is coming, so you point your gun out the window at it. "You better turn back, sea, or I'll shoot!"

Hints

You'll have to think of the "sea" as its own entity, controlling the tsunami, otherwise you might confuse and combine the two. So when you point your gun out the window, aim it at the "sea," not the "tsunami." It's like aiming for the head of a zombie and not the arms or legs.
