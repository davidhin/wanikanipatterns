Hints

Imagine wearing this sack as you're sucked through the vortex of time and space. Feel yourself spinning around as you hurtle back into yesterday.

式 Ritual

The kanji is composed of three radicals. Can you see where the radicals fit in the kanji?
弋 Ceremony 工 Construction

Meaning
Primary
Ritual

Alternatives
Ceremony, Equation

Mnemonic
A good ceremony is under construction for a long time. You can't just make up a new ceremony on the spot. A ceremony is done a certain way because that's the way it's always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a ritual first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.

This kanji also means equation for some reason. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and solving equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.

Hints

Ritual and ceremony kind of mean the same thing. Don't worry too much if you mix them up a little — each will help you to remember the other. There's a reason this kanji is made up of the ceremony radical already!

Readings

しき

Mnemonic
So, you're at a ritual, but not just any old ritual. This is a full-blown ceremony and it's incredibly chic (しき). Imagine just how chic it is. Give it a shot — I'll let you come up with the chicness this time (it's good practice).

Hints

It's good to practice making up your own mnemonics every once in a while. It'll help if you add more to the mnemonics already here, or if you can make up new ones that are more personal to you!

One of the most simple things in the world is getting a tan (たん). All you have to do is stand outside long enough. It doesn't matter what skin type you have or what the weather is like. Eventually, if you stand out there long enough, you'll get a tan.

Hints

If you could have any skill imaginable, what would it be? Wouldn't it be nice to have these magical branching fingers? (Definitely. It would.)

Unfortunately, these skills are too much for the normal skill-less people to handle, so they pull out the guillotine (ぎ). I guess they're going to chop off your skillful fingers because they're kinda scary.

Hints

Imagine a tiny guillotine made for the cutting of fingers. Whoever made this must have had special hand skills too! Then maybe the skill-less people tested it on them…

坂 Slope

土 Dirt 反 Anti

Meaning
Primary
Slope

Mnemonic
Dirt is being anti-social when it's in the shape of a slope. Think about it — is there anything more annoying than having to walk up a steep slope? Why is the dirt here forming a slope?! Because the dirt is being anti-social, and a slope is how it tells you to stay away.

Hints

Imagine the pain in your calves as you walk up a steep slope. Wow, this dirt is really anti-you right now. Going down the slope will be a lot easier and quicker, but that's still just the dirt trying to shoo you away as fast as possible.

Readings

Mnemonic
You need to know these things about slopes if you want to play soccer (さか). Soccer is surprisingly slope-intensive, actually.

Hints
