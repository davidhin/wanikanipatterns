虍 Tiger 胃 Stomach

Meaning
Primary
Skin

Mnemonic
If you look in a tiger's stomach you'll find a bunch of skin. It's really gross but what else did you think you'd find? Everyone knows tigers can't digest the skin of the things it eats.

Hints

Imagine yourself opening a tigers mouth and looking all the way down into its stomach and seeing a bunch of skin. Why would you imagine that? Eww.

車 Car 欠 Lack

Meaning
Primary
Soft

Mnemonic
A car that's lacking is really soft. Cars need to be hard so that things like bugs and other cars wont hurt the people inside when you hit them. But if your car is lacking the hardness it needs, you'll have a really soft, useless car.

Hints

Picture a soft car lacking what it needs to drive down the road. It's so soft it just flops down and won't move.

氵 Tsunami ヨ Wolverine 隹 Turkey

Meaning
Primary
Wash

Mnemonic
A tsunami is coming, so you ask two Wolverines to help you take your turkey out for a wash. Despite the obvious dangers, a giant wave is the only thing that'll wash a giant turkey, so you have no choice.

Hints

Imagine how big and heavy this turkey must be. It's so huge so you need the strength of two Wolverines and the magnitude of a whole tsunami to move it around and wash it.

Readings

Mnemonic
To make sure your turkey won't get carried away by the tsunami while you wash it, you pin it down with a giant tack (たく). If you're washing a giant turkey inside a giant wave, only a giant tack will guarantee it doesn't get washed away.

Hints

If you want to wash your turkey, make sure to have your special tack ready. The tsunami will recede pretty fast, so you need to tack your turkey to the ground if you don't want the sea to take it.
