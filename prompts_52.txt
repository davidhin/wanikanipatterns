牛 Cow 生 Life

Sacrifice

Mnemonic
If you take a cow's life you're turning it into an offering. In the old days, cows' lives were given to the gods as offerings pretty often.

You prepare the offering with your holy blue saber (せい). Normally this would be gruesome, but your saber glows and the cow's life shoots up into the sky without you laying a hand on it.

Hints

Thanks to the mercy of your saber, the offering is quick and painless. A normal saber, however, would have cut that cow to bits. Like, really just wrecked it. Good thing we didn't make you think about that, huh?

禾 Grain 失 Fault

Meaning
Primary
Order

Alternative
Regularity

Mnemonic
If a grain has a fault, it needs to be put back in order. Grains must be perfectly identical at all times, otherwise they'll be thrown out. That's why special people will go out and check them to confirm their regularity. Keeping order is a tough job!

Mnemonic
You can always tell if a company keeps order or if it cheats (ちつ) just by looking at the grains.

Hints

There was once a melon child, that is, a child with the body of a melon. When he was born, his parents didn't want him, so he became an orphan.

毋 Window 貝 Shellfish

Meaning
Primary
Pierce

Alternative
Sushi Counter

Mnemonic
Under the window, you place a shellfish, then slam the window shut to pierce its tough shell. This is the best way to pierce a member of the shellfish family, I promise.

This kanji also has a second meaning. That shellfish you pierced with the window is in two halves now. You can use those halves as plates for sushi. If you count the broken shells you'll know how much sushi you have. That makes them sushi counters!

Hints

Imagine the window piercing into the shellfish's shell. Then imagine lining up the pieces, putting sushi on them, and counting them all.

Now that your shellfish is properly pierced and turned into sushi counters, you can serve them to Genghis Khan (かん) and his men. I really hope you counted them correctly too, because there are a lot of them.

Hints

Carefully count out all the sushi on their pierced shell plates and place them in front of Genghis Khan and his army. As you reach Genghis Khan himself, you realize it's just his ghost, but he's still staring at you as you serve his troops. Ghost or not, you don't want him to pierce you if you mess up.

米 Rice 旦 Dawn 里 Village

立 Stand 風 Wind

Meaning
Primary

If you stand in the wind it will be really quick to knock you over. So quick that you probably won't even know the wind did it. You'll end up standing up only to be knocked over again, just as quick.

Hints

Imagine how quick the wind knocks you over when you stand up. So quick, you don't even remember being up. Try again and count how many seconds it takes for it to knock you down. Less than one. Now that's quick.

Readings

That quick wind is quicker than you can say Satsuki (さつ). And "Satsuki" is a pretty quick sounding name already. Go ahead, say "Satsuki" as quick as you can right now. Heck, try it a few times.

Mnemonic
This potion able to revive any being just has one small downside: it tastes like soap (そ).

Hints

As long as you can get over the awful taste of soap, this is some good, powerful stuff! And considering this'll be administered to dead things… the taste is probably not so important.

忄 Soul 日 Sun 罒 Net 又 Stool

Meaning
Primary
Ridicule

Alternative
Laziness

Mnemonic
If your soul is acting like the sun trapped in a net sitting on a stool, then people will ridicule you for your laziness. You're just sitting there, trapped and not moving.

Hints

Your soul just doesn't want to move or do anything though... and that may look like laziness, but you can't help it. You wish your friends and family wouldn't ridicule you. You're going through enough, internally.

Readings
On’yomi

まん

Kun’yomi

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
When people ridicule you, when you can't stop the laziness, you read manga (まん). Manga helps you feel better about the mean things people say. Manga helps you feel like you're doing something, and that you aren't just a lazy person.

Hints

Picture yourself reading manga and watch as the people who ridicule you and call you lazy fade away into the background. You're going to be okay.

⻌ Scooter 禺 Splinter

Meaning
Primary
Treatment

Alternative
Encounter

Mnemonic
Your poor little scooter got a splinter, so make sure to give it extra nice treatment.

This can also mean encounter. Makes sense when you think about how you first have to encounter someone before deciding how you're going to treat them!

Also, when this means "treatment," note that it doesn't refer to medical treatment, but rather about how you personally treat or receive people.

Hints

These are tough times for your scooter, so be patient with it. Try to treat it with understanding and care.

Readings
On’yomi

ぐう

Kun’yomi

あ

Nanori

None

Mnemonic
Give your scooter only the best treatment, so it can feel real gooooood (ぐう).

Hints

Not just "good", but "gooooood". The long vowel is important here, so try to think of different ways you could make your scooter feel gooooood. Maybe a nice little wash after you’ve removed the splinter will do the trick.
