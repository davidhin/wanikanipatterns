The reef is the Shougun's (しょう) favorite place to be nowadays. He sits next to the water, and stares down into it for hours.

Hints

You don't know if the Shougun likes the reef because he likes the beauty of the ocean, or if he's fantasizing about turkeys boiling. He's a... complex man.

氵 Tsunami 少 Few

Meaning
Primary
Sand

Mnemonic
People think tsunamis are only made of water but they have a few pieces of sand in there too. There's actually more sand in the ocean than most people think. And tsunamis can't just have water and sharks in them. A few grains of sand will always slip in.

Hints

Imagine how those few grains of sand feel to get swept up into a tsunami. They didn't ask for this. They just wanted to stay at the bottom of the sea.
