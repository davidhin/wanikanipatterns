言 Say Death Star

If you try to say something to the Death Star, it would only admonish you. It was made to destroy planets, after all, so I don't know why you'd expect it to have anything nice to say. It just admonishes you about everything you've ever done wrong until you can't stop crying.

Imagine being admonished by the Death Star. It's hovering above you, giant and round, just yelling at you about everything you've ever messed up. It's really awful being yelled at. But the Death Star doing it is particularly scary and embarrassing.

A cross carrying drunkard wants you to go to a rice paddy together so you can receive something from them.

Mnemonic
Against your better judgement, you decided to go and receive the thing. You close your eyes, hold out your hands, and feel a silky, light tie (たい) being placed in them.
